# Introuduction

Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) is a machine learning classification algorithm. In this repository, we implement this model from scratch (no built in library). We use [Raisin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Raisin+Dataset) from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset has 2 classes and 7 features.

# Implementation Details
First, clone the repo using the following command line:

```git clone https://github.com/zillur-av/LDA.git```

We need python ```numpy, pandas, math``` libraries. If you do not have those, install them using pip, i.e ```pip install pandas```.\
Open your jupyter notebook in repository root directory and open ```LDA.ipynb```. Then, run the cells either one by one or all at once. Read the comments and instructions within the code to better understand the implementation.\
**More details are coming soon.**
