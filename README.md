# Introuduction

Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) is a machine learning classification algorithm. In this repository, we implement this model from scratch (no built in library). We use [Raisin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Raisin+Dataset) from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset has 2 classes and 7 features.
